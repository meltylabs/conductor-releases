# Terminal Improvements 
_0.0.16_  
July 18th, 2025 

Improvements: 

- Terminal sessions now persist when navigating between workspaces 

Fixes:

- Fixed default padding in dialogs
- Fixed a bug where the composer would cover more text than necessary 
- Fixed a bug where workspaces wouldn't be reset to `idle` state on app restart
- Fixed a bug where certain workspaces wouldn't load due to an infinite rendering loop
